# require it is that Python 2's subprocess module attempts to encode its
# environment dictionary using the ascii codec, while Powerline decodes it
# using the system's preferred encoding. This causes frequent errors when there
# are non-ASCII characters in the environment. While we could hack around this
# for Python 2, subprocess32 includes other important bug fixes so we thought
# it prudent to use it.
