	 * It doesn't look the greatest to the left of the current window
	 * index, but it allows for more status line real estate.
	 *
	 * Note on the dividers issue: The real problem here is that the
	 * classic Powerline dividers are used as characters in the actual
	 * window status field of tmux and not as tmux window status
	 * separators. This is presumably due to the technical reason that
	 * tmux only allows a global separator string. This means that the
	 * classic Powerline symbols can't truly invert when the current
	 * window changes, as each window status has its own fixed width
	 * which the Powerline dividers inhabit. If this is not done, then
	 * the window statuses shift when the current window changes. The
	 * end result of this is that each divider takes up twice the
	 * amount of space it actually needs, to reserve space for it when
	 * it's not present. Ugh.
