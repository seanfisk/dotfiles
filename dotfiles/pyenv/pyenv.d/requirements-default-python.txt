# List of packages that can be used with these dotfiles.
# Intended to be installed to the default Python.

# Powerline stuff
#
# powerline-status itself is specified in the default virtualenv
# requirements (which is run by the 'pyup' script).
#
# Powerline is able to work with pygit2 -or- the plain git executable.
# Installing pygit2 is disabled by default because it has dependencies
# (libgit2, which depends on cmake) which are not necessarily simple
# to install. That said, with Homebrew, installing pygit2 is rather
# easy so we may as well. First, make sure that your default python
# and pip come first on the PATH. Then run:
#
#     brew install libgit2
#
# Now install pygit2. Only use '--user' if the default Python is also
# the system Python.
#
#     pip install --user pygit2==0.23.3 cffi==1.5.2 pycparser==2.14
