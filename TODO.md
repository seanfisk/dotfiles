TODO for Sean Fisk's Dotfiles
=============================

* Use Python json module for Powerline.
* Take availability of bash and zsh into account.
* Add fasd for Emacs.
* Make adding nodes to both shells a bit more elegant.
* Write a command for updating the dotfiles and emacs repos.
* Make (pyenv and rbenv Powerline support) an actual Python module.
* Figure out how to restart `ssh-agent` on Mac OS X when I accidentally kill it (do this: `launchctl start org.openbsd.ssh-agent`)
* Include some things from http://mths.be/dotfiles.
* Get SSH keys under control. Decide which ones need to be shared.
