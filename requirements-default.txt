# List of packages that can be used with these dotfiles.
# Intended to be installed to the default Python.

# Powerline stuff
#
# Powerline is able to work with pygit2 -or- the plain git executable.
# Installing pygit2 is disabled by default because it has dependencies
# (libgit2, which depends on cmake) which are not necessarily simple
# to install. That said, with Homebrew, installing pygit2 is rather
# easy so we may as well. First, make sure that your default python
# and pip come first on the PATH. Then run:
#
#     brew install libgit2
#
# pygit2 requires cffi to be installed first (annoyingly). Only use
# '--user' if the default Python is also the system Python.
#
#     pip install --user cffi==0.8.6
#
# Finally install pygit2:
#
#     pip install --user pygit2==0.21.2
#
powerline-status==1.2
psutil==2.1.3
bzr==2.6.0
pycparser==2.10
mercurial==3.2.2

# Portable archive file manager
patool==1.7
