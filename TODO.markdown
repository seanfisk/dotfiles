TODO for Sean Fisk's Dotfiles
=============================

* Fix platform-specific stuff (i.e., /proc/cpuinfo)
* Local configuration
    * Create a file, maybe called `.bashrc_local' and `.zshrc_local' that
      contains local modifications (specific to that machine)
* Installation / Removal
    * Improve install script
    * Add removal script
* wd (working-directory)
    * Port it to zsh, possibly improve it
    * Look into alternatives like [da](https://github.com/nitrogoldfish/da)
* oh-my-zsh
    * Customize it (probably fork it)
    * Remove the `cd` function, for sure. It's annoying.
    * Remove other unecessary stuff
