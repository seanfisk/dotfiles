TODO for Sean Fisk's Dotfiles
=============================

* Figure out why MANPATH isn't getting set correctly in bash but it is in zsh.
    * Definitely has to do with `/etc/zshenv` and `/usr/libexec/path_helper`.
* Write a function for creating a new tmux tab and automatically naming it.
* Investigate other or "more proper" ways of swapping Caps Lock and
  Control under X11.
* Get SSH keys under control. Decide which ones need to be shared, and
  add a passphrase or something using `ssh-agent`.
