TODO for Sean Fisk's Dotfiles
=============================

* Figure out why MANPATH isn't getting set correctly in bash but it is in zsh.
    * Definitely has to do with `/etc/zshenv` and `/usr/libexec/path_helper`.
* Write a function for creating a new tmux tab and automatically naming it.
* Update README with all the changes.
