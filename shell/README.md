Modules Directory
=================

This directory contains modules that can be included in a shell configuration. They are meant to be sourced in, not run standalone.

*These files only target Bash 4 and Zsh 5*. If the file is shell-specific, the extensions `.bash` or `.zsh` are used. If the file is designed for both shells, the extension `sh` is used. *Note that an* `sh` *extension does not mean it will run in the true Bourne shell* `sh`, *nor any other shells other than those mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph*.

A `.in` extension indicates that the file is a target for templating.
