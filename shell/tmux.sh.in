	# We use exec so that the SSH session replaces our current shell. I usually use a separate shell for SSH connections.
	# All args are passed to `ssh' *before* the remote command. This allows us to easily specify, e.g., `-X'.
	# By using -c, we are telling bash that it should not be invoked as a non-interactive login shell. However, if it's not a login shell, it won't read our .bash_profile, which includes setting the PATH to find tmux, powerline stuff, etc. This is necessary, and we haven't been able to make everything work correctly if tmux-attach-or-new is made into a script. Also, if it's not interactive, it won't get far enough to read our functions and aliases (of which tmux_attach_or_new is one). Therefore we need to add `--login -i' to the command-line.
	# By calling `tmux_attach_or_new' on the *remote* server we are assuming that the dotfiles are installed on the remote server. Errors will ensue if these assumptions are not correct.
	exec ssh -t "$@" 'bash --login -i -c tmux-attach-or-new'
